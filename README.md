# Create Virtual Environment
In a terminal run the following commands from the root folder of the forked project.

Windows

```bash 
python -m venv .\venv

macOS & Linux

```bach 
python -m venv ./venv

Once that completes, also run this command from the same folder.

Windows

'''bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

macOS & Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

Now that you are working in the virtualenv, install the project dependencies with the following command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
